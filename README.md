Minecraft versions go by so quickly now it feels like we constantly have to update our modpacks.
It takes hours to scour Modrinth to try and find newer versions of your mods.
This is where my script comes in.

It will scan your mod folder and automatically search and download them for another Minecraft version and mod loader.

This will give you a great head start when it comes to updating or porting your packs.

It is very easy to use.
You just have to have nodeJS installed and run ModpackUpdateManagerNodeJS.sh

You can configure the script using the ModpackUpdateManagerNodeJS-config.json file.
